**Photo Portfolio**

<div class="img img--fullContainer img--14xLeading" style="background-image: url({{ site.baseurl_featured_img }}guitar.jpg);"></div>

Excited to launch my new photo portfolio. It is based on <a href= "http://jpdias.me/portfolio-photo/">Jo√£o Pedro Dias's</a> work on Jekyll based website. I still have a lot to change to it. It will be an incremental process. I hope to update at least once a week.
